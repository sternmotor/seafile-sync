# `seaf-cli status` output csv-like information with tabulates as separators and columns named in comment lines.
# The Seafile client should not be restarted while some statuses are occuring, such as "downloading" or "committing".
#
# This script grabs the output while ignoring the comments to iterate over the informations set to their columns,
# then it compares the statuses, when not empty, to the ones that do not require a restart. Finally either restart or don't.
